        <h2>About Me</h2>
<p class="padding">
  I was born and raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil and studied at an American school calles Graded School. In 2014 I moved with my parents, my younger sister and our three dogs to Coral Gables and I started my freshman year at the University of Miami. I will be graduating in May of 2018 with a  Bachelor of Science in Communication in Public Relations and minors in marketing and psychology.
</p>
<p class="padding">I really enjoy traveling and have been doing so since I was little. I have been to 36 countries with my family across all continents and I plan on visiting every single country at least once throughout my life. Iâ€™m also really passionate about animals and want to work with endangered species in Africa after I graduate. Some other hobbies I have are singing in the car, doing all kinds of puzzles, baking from scratch and watching Netflix with my boyfriend.
