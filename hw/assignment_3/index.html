        <h2>About Me</h2>
<p class="padding">
I was born and raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil and moved to Coral Gables in 2014 for my freshman year at the University of Miami.
Yes, either that or I'm a Public Relations major and this class is a requirement.
I also have three minors; marketing, psychology and journalism.
Now, you may be thinking I must be an overachiever or something but the truth is that my collection of minors is the result of my inability to stick to a single major for more than a semester.
I still don't have a clear idea of what I want to be when I grow up, even though I've stopped I growing a while ago and can legally drink in the US.
What I do know is that I enjoy writing and most of my PR classes, so I think I'm on the right track.
As for my hobbies, I like baking, singing in the car and watching Netflix with my two Pomeranians.
