<h1 id="title">How to Make Brigadeiro
<i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-left"></i>
</h1>
<p>Brigadeiros are bite-size Brazilian chocolate sweets. Some people say they are bon-bons, other people say they are truffles… I think they come closer to fudge balls. <br> The name “brigadeiro” means “brigadier” in English. According to popular beliefs, the Brigadeiro was created in honor of Brazilian Brigadier Eduardo Gomes in the 40s. Gomes was a good looking (single!!) fellow and because of that he conquered a vast number of female fans that ended up creating this candy that now carries his title. In spite of Eduardo Gomes’ good looks, he didn’t win the elections! However, he will be forever remembered in every Brazilian birthday party, as brigadeiros of all kinds are always served in birthday parties.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 (14oz) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
<li>4 Tbsp cocoa powder</li>
<li>2 Tbsp butter, plus more for rolling balls</li>
<li>Chocolate sprinkles to decorate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Mix the Ingredients</h2>

<p>In a small sauce pan mix the condensed milk, the cocoa powder and the butter.</p>
</li>

<h2>Step 2: Cook it</h2>

<p>Bring the sauce pan to the stove and heat it over medium-low heat. Cook it, mixing constantly (this is important, otherwise it will burn!) until it thickens. A way to know is to run your wooden spoon in the middle of the mixture. If it takes a while for the mixture to move, then your brigadeiro is ready!</p>

<h2>Step 3: Let it Cool Down</h2>

<p>Reserve, letting it cool to room temperature. Put it in the fridge if you want to speed up the process.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Step 4: Roll Them Up</h2>

<p>Once the brigadeiro is cool, grease your hands with butter and roll the brigadeiros into little balls. In Brazil we usually use half a tablespoon as measurement, but you can make your balls as big or small as you'd like! </p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Step 5: Add the Sprinkles</h2>

<p>In a plate or bowl, spread your sprinkles. Roll the brigadeiro balls into the sprinkles and place them in paper/foil candy cups.</p>
